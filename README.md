# Wealth Calculator

This application was to practice array methods; sort, filter, map, forEach and reduce.  
It uses the random user API to add the first and last name of a new user and append them to the table with a Math function to calculate a starting wealth.
The sidebar of buttons run standard array methods and then updates the DOM with the revised data.
